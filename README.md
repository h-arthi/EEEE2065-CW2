A number guessing game created as part of an assignment

There are two modes to this game:
1. A human guesses the number
2. A computer guesses the number

## Computer Guess
- This method a simple implementation of the binary search algortithm
- The user can choose how many times they want the computer to play the game
- At the end of the computer game, a historgram is printed with the number of guesses
  it takes for the computer to get the right answer and the maximum number or guesses is printed
 
## Future Improvements:
- Prevent users from entering string and  'breaking' the program
- Improve modualrity of code
